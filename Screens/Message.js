        <Text> Message for you mother: 
        
        My mother is the most important person in my life. It’s not important to have a specific date to wish love for the mother. But always there should be something to celebrate. May 9th 2021 is Mothers day. The whole world celebrates this day as mother day. It’s a really special day for everyone.

Everyone has their own mother. Anyone can’t say he/she doesn’t have a mother. If your mom is alive on this day, you should spend the whole day with her. Mothers are really special; they sacrifice so many things for their children. I love my mom very much. I am also greatful for what she has done for me.
